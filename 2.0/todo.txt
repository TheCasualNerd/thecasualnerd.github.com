This document will be a list of pending changes that need to be made with full detail as to what they should do.

Project Homepage Display:
    Investigate using Jekyll to make project pages and subsequently adding them to the homepage.
    The system will use different icons based on the project type (Some rudimentary categories include: CAD, Robotics, Web, Misc)
    Example:
        ________________ ________________ ________________
        | Project Name  |                |                |
        |               |                |                |
        |               |                |                |
        |     Link      |                |                |
        ---------------- ---------------- ----------------
    For the meantime, use placeholder images
Font sizing:
    Use only vh, no vw
    vw will be for padding and margins
    keep it consistent.
